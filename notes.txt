In importing a built in module,you don't use ('./') instead ("os") so node knows you are looking for a built in module
a path module allows u to interact with file paths easily
        methods/Property in path module
A seperator is a property that returns a platform specicfic seperator it's syntax is (path.sep)
the join method is a method that joins a sequence of paths segments using that platform specific separator as the limiter
to access the last path in a file path , you use (.basename)
to access the absolute path use (.resolve) :i.e it accepts a sequence of path/path segment and resolves it into an absolute path


To create a new file you can use the writeFileSync method /eg/ 
writeFileSync(
    './content/result-sync.txt',
     `Here is the result : ${first}, ${second}`
    )
note if the file is not there node will automatically create one
     if the file is there node by default will overwrite them
